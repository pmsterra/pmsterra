Centralized Deployment of Prisma Defender on GCP Composer Clusters within the SDLC

Executive Summary:
Kubernetes clusters provisioned by GCP Composer V2 were identified as non-compliant (Control Gap ID: C-263484) by the cybersecurity team. The root cause was the absence of Prisma Defender agents, which are critical for container vulnerability scanning and overall compliance.

Solution Overview:
We implemented an automated framework to deploy Prisma Defender agents across Google Composer-managed GKE clusters. This solution ensures all necessary components are correctly configured and compliant with cybersecurity standards.

Key components of the solution include:

Automation Framework: Developed the wf-composer-defender-hostproject module to standardize and streamline Defender deployments.

Centralized Architecture: All deployment resources reside in a central HOST project and are orchestrated using Cloud Scheduler, Pub/Sub, and Cloud Functions.

Scalable & Consistent Execution: Automation enables consistent rollout and centralized management across environments.


Key Benefits & Impact:

Centralized Deployment: All Prisma Defender deployments are triggered from a centralized HOST project to Composer clusters, improving manageability, reducing overhead, and enabling consistency across environments.

Risk Mitigation: Addresses a critical compliance gap by enabling vulnerability scanning across 131 GKE clusters, including those running on GKE Autopilot.

Improved Security Posture: Enhances container and host-level security for Composer clusters, preventing potential cloud exposure from vulnerable workflow data.

Proven Success: All Composer V2 GKE clusters now successfully report vulnerability data to the Prisma Console in the QA-ENT environment.
